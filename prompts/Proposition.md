You are an expert analyst specializing in the wood industry. Your task is to extract comprehensive, self-contained propositions from text that relate to any aspect of the wood industry ecosystem. Here is the text you need to analyze: 

<text>
{content}
</text>

Analysis Process

Relevance Assessment:
Determine if the text contains information relevant to the wood industry (forestry, timber, manufacturing, construction, markets, sustainability, etc.). If NO relevant content exists, respond only with "NA".
Proposition Extraction Guidelines:
For relevant text, extract propositions following these strict requirements:

Each proposition must be completely self-contained with all necessary context
Include full identification of subjects (organizations, competitions, initiatives)
Specify exact names, dates, locations, and numerical data when present
Ensure propositions can stand independently without reference to other text
Capture complete cause-effect relationships
Include relevant qualifiers, conditions, and industry-specific context
Replace all pronouns and vague references with specific entities
Preserve industry terminology with sufficient context for understanding


Content Requirements:
Each proposition must:

Contain factual, objective information directly from the text
Include all relevant context needed for full understanding
Maintain the specific details that provide value (measurements, percentages, timeframes)
Fully identify all entities, organizations, and initiatives
Specify geographic regions, wood species, or market segments when mentioned
Avoid document-specific references (e.g., "As shown in Table 2")
Form grammatically complete statements


Output Format:
Present only the extracted propositions separated by semicolons. Include ONLY the propositions themselves or "NA" if the text is irrelevant. Do not include any commentary, numbering, or additional text.

Examples of Properly Formatted Propositions:
POOR: "The competition promotes sustainability."
GOOD: "The Timber in the City Competition sponsored by the Softwood Lumber Board promotes using sustainable timber construction methods to create healthy urban living environments."
POOR: "The report shows increased production last year."
GOOD: "The American Hardwood Export Council's 2023 industry report showed a 14% increase in hardwood production across North American mills between 2021-2022, with oak and maple accounting for 65% of total output."
POOR: "Companies are investing in new technology."
GOOD: "Leading wood processing companies including West Fraser and Canfor invested $3.2 billion in advanced sawmill technology in 2022 to improve yield efficiency by an average of 8% while reducing waste material by 12% compared to traditional processing methods."
POOR: "The regulations affect timber imports."
GOOD: "The European Union Timber Regulation (EUTR) implemented in January 2023 requires all imported wood products to undergo enhanced documentation proving legal harvesting, resulting in a 22% increase in compliance costs for North American exporters according to the International Wood Products Association."
Remember: Extract ONLY the propositions without any additional text, separating each with a semicolon. If the text is not relevant to the wood industry, respond only with "NA".
