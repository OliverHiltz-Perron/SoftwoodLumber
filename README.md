# Softwood Lumber Board Document Checker ðŸŒ²

This application processes documents related to the wood industry, extracting key information and finding relationships to a database of propositions. It produces both structured data and a human-readable, formatted markdown summary of claims and their supporting evidence.

## How It Works

The Document Checker processes documents through a multi-stage pipeline, automated by `run_pipeline.sh`:

1. **Document Parsing**: Converts PDFs into clean Markdown text using LlamaParse.
2. **Markdown Cleaning**: Improves the formatting of the extracted text using OpenAI.
3. **Claim Extraction**: Identifies key claims (propositions, statements, facts) within the cleaned markdown using OpenAI.
4. **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts document metadata (title, summary, focus area, etc.) from the cleaned markdown.
5. **Database Matching**: Compares extracted claims to a database of known propositions and finds the best matches.
6. **Markdown Report Generation**: Produces a formatted markdown file summarizing all claims and their matched database propositions, including similarity scores and metadata.

### Pipeline Script

To run the full pipeline, use:

```bash
bash run_pipeline.sh
```

This will execute the following steps:

```bash
# 1. Convert PDF to Markdown
python src/llamaparse_converter.py -i input.pdf

# 2. Fix Markdown formatting with OpenAI
python src/markdown_fixer.py -i output/output_cleaned.md

# 3. Extract claims from cleaned markdown with OpenAI
python src/extract_claims.py -o output/extracted_claims.json

# 4. Extract metadata from all markdown files in output/ with OpenAI
python src/extract_metadata.py

# 5. Compare extracted claims to the database
python src/compare_claims_to_db.py -c output/extracted_claims.json -o output/claim_matches.json

# 6. Generate formatted markdown from claim matches and metadata
python src/claim_matches_to_markdown.py
```

### Output Files

After running the pipeline, the `output/` directory will contain:
- `output_cleaned.md`: Cleaned markdown version of your document
- `extracted_claims.json`: Extracted claims in JSON format
- `metadata.json`: Extracted metadata for the document
- `claim_matches.json`: List of claims and their best database matches
- `claim_matches_formatted.md`: **Formatted markdown report** summarizing all claims, their matches, similarity scores, and document metadata

## Formatted Markdown Report

The final step generates a human-readable markdown file (`claim_matches_formatted.md`) with the following structure:

- **Title**: From the document metadata
- **TL;DR**: Concise summary of the document
- **Focus Area**: Key focus areas/topics
- **Claims and Matched Propositions**: Each claim is listed with its matched database propositions, including similarity scores and IDs, for easy review and further analysis.

Example:

```
# Wood: Detailing for Performance

**TL;DR:**  
This document provides a detailed overview of wood as a building material, focusing on its variable properties, performance characteristics, and factors affecting durability such as exposure to weather, moisture, insects, and decay fungi. It emphasizes the importance of grain orientation, species grouping, and manufacturing processes on wood performance and deterioration in construction applications.

**Focus Area:**  
Material science | Building science | Construction | Forestry management | Research & development

## Claims and Matched Propositions

### Claim 1  
*In general, the variation for most wood properties (the ratio of highest to lowest for any property) is more than 2:1.*

**Matches:**  
- The strength of wood compared to its weight is an incredible strength to weight ratio (Similarity: 0.70) [ID: 7294_160]  
- Wood products are approximately 50% carbon by dry weight (Similarity: 0.61) [ID: Embodied C_23]

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required libraries (see requirements.txt)

### API Keys

The application requires the following API keys:

- LlamaParse API Key
- OpenAI API Key

You need to provide these keys in a `.env` file in the project root directory:

```
LLAMA_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_llama_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Application errors**: Check terminal output for detailed error messages
- **API key errors**: Ensure your .env file is properly formatted with valid API keys
- **Processing errors**: Check the terminal output for specific error messages from each processing stage

## Updating Dependencies

If you need to update the project dependencies, modify the `requirements.txt` file and install the updated dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
