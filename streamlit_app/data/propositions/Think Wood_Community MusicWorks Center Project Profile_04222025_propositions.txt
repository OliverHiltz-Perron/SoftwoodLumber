- The Community MusicWorks Center in Providence, Rhode Island, a 24,000 square foot facility designed by 3SIX0 Architects and built by Pezzuco Construction Inc., utilizes cross-laminated timber (CLT) and glulam as primary structural materials
- The use of CLT and glulam in the Community MusicWorks Center provided acoustic benefits, creating a warm and resonant environment suitable for a music performance hall, while also aligning with the community's aesthetic preferences for wood
- The Community MusicWorks Center's mass timber construction, supported by WSP USA Buildings Inc. as structural engineer and using timber products supplied by Element5 | HASSLACHER Group, offered speed of erection and lower carbon impact compared to traditional concrete and steel construction
- Acoustic challenges in the Community MusicWorks Center, such as vibration control and sound isolation between spaces, were addressed through double-wall construction, concrete topping on CLT floors, rubber separators, and a box-in-box system for practice rooms
- The design of the Community MusicWorks Center evolved from an initially envisioned pure CLT structure to a hybrid system combining CLT slabs, glulam beams and columns, and light-frame wood construction, enhancing affordability and design flexibility
- The Community MusicWorks Center's design, incorporating angled geometries derived from the intersecting city grid, created a porous, outward-looking structure that fostered community interaction and engagement
- The interior finishes of the Community MusicWorks Center's performance hall, featuring exposed two-by-fours, reflect the organization's ethos of community building and ongoing evolution
- The exterior of the Community MusicWorks Center features responsibly sourced Ipe cladding, continuing the theme of angular motion and musical pacing established in the building's design
- The acoustic design of the Community MusicWorks Center's performance hall, implemented with Arup as the acoustic consultant, involved using an optimization algorithm to test thousands of combinations of angled wood panels to achieve optimal sound reflection, diffusion, and absorption.
