      "id": "Think Wood_4",
      "text": "Acoustic challenges in the Community MusicWorks Center, such as vibration control and sound isolation between spaces, were addressed through double-wall construction, concrete topping on CLT floors, rubber separators, and a box-in-box system for practice rooms"

      "id": "Think Wood_5",
      "text": "The design of the Community MusicWorks Center evolved from an initially envisioned pure CLT structure to a hybrid system combining CLT slabs, glulam beams and columns, and light-frame wood construction, enhancing affordability and design flexibility"
