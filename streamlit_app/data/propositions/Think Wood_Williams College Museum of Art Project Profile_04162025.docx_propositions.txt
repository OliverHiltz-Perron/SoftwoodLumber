- The Williams College Museum of Art, located in Williamstown, Massachusetts, is under construction
- The 76,800-square-foot building, designed by SO–IL and under construction, will utilize mass timber construction to target Living Building Challenge 4.0 Core Green Building Certification
- The building's mass timber structure features glulam post-and-beam construction supporting a CLT roof deck with an undulating design
- The project represents what the design team believes is the first use of warped CLT panels (eight feet by 30 feet and roughly four inches thick) in construction, achieving a curvature limited by the panel's natural deformation under its own weight
- The warped CLT panels' design was informed by full-scale experiments conducted at Nordic Structures' facility in northern Quebec
- The installed CLT panels will have a significant bend, with a 16 to 18-inch difference between corners
- Most glulam beams will be straight, though some will have curvature in two axes, precisely cut as varied trapezoidal members to provide a flush upper surface for the CLT
- The use of warped CLT panels and curved glulam beams did not require changes to standard CLT specifications or tolerances, maintaining minimal waste
- The building's complex geometries increased upfront time for 3D modeling and coordination between the architect (SO–IL), engineers (Fast + Epp), and fabricator (Nordic Structures)
- The CNC milling process accommodated both rectangular and parallelogram beams with equal precision and accuracy
- The building's finish materials will include oversized green masonry blocks, bluestone floors, and metal roof shingles, with exposed wood structure in many public spaces
- The project is scheduled to open during the museum's centennial year, 2026–27.
