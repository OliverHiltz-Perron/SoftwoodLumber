With
 
a
 
Twist
 
 
For
 
more
 
than
 
a
 
century ,
 
the
 
Williams
 
College
 
Museum
 
of
 
Art
 
has
 
been
 
housed
 
in
 
a
 
historic
 
red
 
brick-clad
 
building
 
in
 
the
 
heart
 
of
 
the
 
academic
 
campus
 
in
 
Williamstown,
 
Massachusetts.
 
While
 
the
 
facility
 
was
 
extensively
 
renovated
 
in
 
postmodern
 
fashion
 
by
 
Charles
 
Moore
 
in
 
the
 
1980s,
 
the
 
museum
 
has
 
never
 
had
 
a
 
purpose-built
 
structure—until
 
now.
 
 
 
Currently
 
under
 
construction,
 
the
 
new
 
76,800-square-foot
 
building
 
is
 
designed
 
by
 
Brooklyn-based
 
SO
 
–
 
IL
 
and
 
will
 
include
 
galleries,
 
dynamic
 
classrooms,
 
a
 
study
 
center ,
 
an
 
auditorium,
 
and
 
a
 
café
 
organized
 
as
 
individual
 
pavilions
 
around
 
an
 
enclosed
 
central
 
space.
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
functions
 
are
 
located
 
on
 
a
 
single
 
floor
 
under
 
an
 
undulating
 
metal-shingle-clad
 
roof
 
that
 
will
 
define
 
the
 
building’ s
 
presence
 
on
 
a
 
prominent
 
site
 
at
 
the
 
entrance
 
to
 
Williamstown.
 
“The
 
initial
 
concept
 
was
 
this
 
unifying
 
roof
 
that
 
brought
 
together
 
a
 
diverse
 
set
 
of
 
programs
 
that
 
was
 
informed
 
by
 
the
 
fact
 
that
 
as
 
a
 
one-story
 
building,
 
there
 
are
 
many
 
different
 
heights
 
below
 
it,”

which

reduction
 
in
 
carbon
 
for

superstructure.
 
The
 
glulam

post-and-beam
 
construction
 
supports
 
a
 
CLT
 
roof
 
deck,
 
but
 
that’s
 
where
 
convention
 
ends.

conceived
 
the
 
roof
 
as
 
an

all-encompassing
 
surface
 
that
 
gathers
 
interior
 
and
 
exterior
 
spaces
 
under
 
its
 
fluid
 
forms.
 
These

geometries
 
posed
 
a

Warped
 
Wood
 
The
 
solution
 
involves
 
what
 
the
 
team
 
believes
 
is
 
the
 
first
 
use
 
of
 
warped
 
CLT
 
panels.
 
Warped
 
CLT
 
might
 
bring
 
to
 
mind
 
the
 
19
th
 
century
 
development
 
of
 
bentwood
 
furniture,
 
in
 
which
 
wood
 
members
 
were
 
bent
 
while
 
steamed
 
and
 
held
 
in
 
position
 
to
 
dry
 
in
 
their
 
new
 
configuration.
 
But
 
that’s
 
not
 
how
 
it’s
 
done
 
with
 
mass
 
timber .
 
CLT
 
panels
3
 
are
 
considerably
 
larger
 
than
 
a
 
chair;
 
eight
 
feet
 
by
 
30
 
feet
 
and
 
roughly
 
four
 
inches
 
thick
 
is
 
the
 
norm
 
for
 
a
 
project
 
at
 
this
 
scale.
 
 
 
The
 
Fast
 
+
 
Epp
 
engineers
 
began
 
their
 
analysis
 
by
 
calculating
 
how
 
much
 
a
 
panel,
 
if
 
supported
 
in
 
just
 
two
 
or
 
three
 
places
 
instead
 
of
 
at
 
all
 
the
 
normal
 
points,
 
would
 
naturally
 
bend
 
under
 
its
 
own
 
weight,
 
while
 
still
 
remaining
 
completely
 
structurally
 
sound.
 
“We
 
came
 
to
 
the
 
conclusion
 
that
 
one
 
guiding
 
thing
 
to
 
inform
 
the
 
geometry
 
was,
 
‘Let's
 
try
 
and
 
limit
 
the
 
roof
 
curvature
 
to
 
however
 
much
 
the
 
panel
 
can
 
deform
 
at
 
its
 
own
 
weight,’”
 
Fast
 
+
 
Epp
 
Partner
 
Tobias
 
Fast
 
says.
 
It
 
was
 
at
 
this
 
stage
 
that
 
the
 
early
 
participation
 
of
 
the
 
fabricator ,
 
Nordic
 
Structures
,
 
became
 
key.
 
“We
 
went
 
to
 
their
 
facility
 
in
 
northern
 
Quebec
 
and
 
they
 
built
 
a
 
mockup
 
of
 
the
 
most
 
warped
 
piece
 
of
 
the
 
building
 
and
 
it
 
succeeded,”
 
Molloy
 
says.
 
 
 
Based
 
on
 
those
 
full-scale
 
experiments,
 
the
 
installed
 
CLT
 
panels
 
will
 
have
 
a
 
significant
 
bend
 
when
 
the
 
mass
 
timber
 
is
 
installed
 
on
 
site
 
this
 
summer .
 
“It's
 
somewhere
 
[between]
 
16
 
to
 
18
 
inches
 
difference
 
from
 
one
 
corner
 
of
 
the
 
panel
 
to
 
the
 
other
 
corner
 
of
 
the
 
panel,”
 
Fast
 
says.
 
 
 
Most
 
of
 
the
 
glulam
 
beams
 
will
 
be
 
straight,
 
although
 
a
 
few
 
will
 
have
 
curvature
 
in
 
two
 
axes.
 
Each
 
beam
 
will
 
be
 
precisely
 
cut
 
in
 
the
 
shop
 
as
 
a
 
varied
 
trapezoidal
 
member
 
that
 
will
 
provide
 
a
 
flush
 
upper
 
surface
 
to
 
receive
 
the
 
CLT.
 
Fast
 
notes
 
that
 
the
 
engineers
 
have
 
been
 
regularly
 
asked
 
whether
 
the
 
curved
 
elements
 
will
 
result
 
in
 
changes
 
in
 
tolerance.
 
Amazingly ,
 
Fast
 
+
 
Epp
 
have
 
not
 
varied
 
their
 
standard
 
CLT
 
specifications
 
in
 
the
 
slightest:
 
“They’re
 
still
 
working
 
to
 
the
 
same
 
level
 
of
 
tolerance
 
and
 
minimal
 
waste
 
that
 
they
 
would
 
in
 
any
 
other
 
project.”
 
 
 
Admittedly ,
 
the
 
building’ s
 
complex
 
geometries
 
have
 
added
 
more
 
upfront
 
time
 
for
 
3D
 
modeling
 
and
 
coordination
 
between
 
architect,
 
engineers,
 
and
 
fabricators.
 
But
 
the
 
CNC
 
milling
 
doesn’t
 
discriminate
 
between
 
geometries.
 
“The
 
difference
 
between
 
a
 
rectangular
 
beam
 
and
 
a
 
parallelogram
 
beam
 
doesn't
 
have
 
any
 
impact
 
on
 
the
 
fabrication
 
process,”
 
Molloy
 
says.
 
“You
 
get
 
the
 
same
 
level
 
of
 
precision
 
and
 
accuracy .”

while
 
the

connections
